## 📆 Addional Development Updates

### 🧱 Component Architecture Refactor

- **Renamed Home component to Dashboard** – Better reflects the application's purpose as a job tracking dashboard
- **Implemented component-specific CSS architecture** – Each component now has its own CSS file to prevent inheritance conflicts and improve maintainability
- **Cleaned up global App.css** – Stripped down to essential global styles only (body, fonts)

### 🎨 UI Improvements

- **Enhanced Navigation** – Added specific CSS classes and improved button styling with distinct colors
- **Restored main container frame** – Added visual separation between navigation and dashboard content with border, background, and shadow effects
- **Improved visual hierarchy** – Clean separation between global styles and component-specific styling

### 🛠️ Technical Improvements

- **Better file organization** – Component-specific CSS files imported directly into components
- **Eliminated CSS conflicts** – Removed generic button/nav styles that were causing inheritance issues
- **Semantic CSS classes** – All components now use specific, meaningful class names

## 🚀 Upcoming Features (Monday) June 23rd, 2025

- **Sort functionality** – Dropdown with options to sort by Date and Status
- **Filter functionality** – Dropdown to filter applications by Status, Company, etc.
- **Enhanced navigation** – Additional nav buttons for improved user experience

## 📄 Current Features

## 📦 MVP Completion Summary

As of June 24, 2025, the core MVP for the Application Tracker has been completed. Key accomplishments from this final push include:

- ✅ Successful implementation of full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Delete)
- ✅ Refined component structure and prop flow (especially `Read.jsx`)
- ✅ Extracted `fetchData` for reusable, prop-driven state updates
- ✅ Ensured consistent styling and UI feedback across Dashboard and Read components
- ✅ Finalized scoped class naming for maintainable CSS
- ✅ Added concise date labels and improved visual hierarchy for card displays
- ✅ Clean frontend-backend integration with proper state synchronization

This version represents a stable, fully functional job application tracking system with core CRUD workflow. Update functionality is planned for future iterations.
