## 📦 MVP Completion Summary
As of June 24, 2025, the core MVP for the Application Tracker has been completed. Key accomplishments from this final push include:
- ✅ Successful implementation of full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Delete)
- ✅ Refined component structure and prop flow (especially `Read.jsx`)
- ✅ Extracted `fetchData` for reusable, prop-driven state updates
- ✅ Ensured consistent styling and UI feedback across Dashboard and Read components
- ✅ Finalized scoped class naming for maintainable CSS
- ✅ Added concise date labels and improved visual hierarchy for card displays
- ✅ Clean frontend-backend integration with proper state synchronization

This version represents a stable, fully functional job application tracking system with core CRUD workflow. Update functionality is planned for future iterations.
